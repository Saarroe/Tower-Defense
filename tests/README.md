# Tests

This folder contains some test files used to test creating balloons and initializing map. 
The code was tested mainly by running the game. 


## Test File: testwave.txt

Involved Classes: Game_engine, Defense, Balloon

Results: We tested the game using a very simple testwave file. With this file we were able to see if the balloons appeared to the map and we were able to shoot those. Using this text file, all balloon types are created once. 

## Test File: testmap.txt

Involved Classes: Game_engine, Map, Map_tile, MapTileGraphics

Results: This file was used to create a very simple map to the screen.
