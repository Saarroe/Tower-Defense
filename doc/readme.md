# Contents

After completing the development, you must create a documentation for your project. The documentation should be a PDF document, and should be composed of following parts:

Overview: what the software does, what it doesn’t do? (this can be taken/updated from the project plan)

Software structure: overall architecture, class relationships diagrams, interfaces to external libraries

Instructions for building and using the software

How to compile the program (‘make’ should be sufficient), as taken from the git repository. If external libraries are needed, describe the requirements here

How to use the software: a basic user guide

Testing: how the different modules in software were tested, description of the methods and outcomes.

Work log: a detailed description of the division of work and everyone’s responsibilities. For each week, a description of what was done and roughly how many hours were used for the project by each project member.
